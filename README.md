# Code Refactor Starter Code
What i did in this code was sort everything out i put sections and comments where they needed to be so the code could look nicer and more presentable I also had to move a file to a different folder to get it to work properly in which i had to change its from ./assets/css/style.css to ./Develop/assets/css/style.css the reason behind is the photos did not want to work when i moved a file to a different folder so i had to update its pathing to where the photos would show in the website.
